# BizmanageCRM Custom Scripts for actions

## Introduction

At BizmanageCRM we allow you to write custom javascript code that can be attached to an action and executed when the action is triggered.

## what is an action?
A custom action is a trigger that can be added to the system. When the trigger is activated, the system will execute the custom code that is attached to the action.
It can be in the form of a button, a link, a menu item, or any other trigger that can be added to the system.

## BMML action environment
An action is always attached to a bizmznage view, and one or multiple rows.
